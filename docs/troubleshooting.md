# Troubleshooting Guide for AI Workshop

This document provides troubleshooting tips for common issues that participants may encounter during the AI workshop. If you experience any problems, please refer to the relevant section below.

## 1. Environment Setup Issues

### Python Version
- **Problem**: Python version is not 3.10 or higher.
- **Solution**: Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. You can check your Python version by running:
  ```
  python --version
  ```
  If you need to install or upgrade Python, visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Package Installation
- **Problem**: Some required packages are missing.
- **Solution**: Make sure to install all necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  For GPU support, also install packages from `requirements_gpu.txt` if applicable.

## 2. Jupyter Notebook Issues

### Kernel Not Starting
- **Problem**: The Jupyter notebook kernel fails to start.
- **Solution**: Ensure that you have Jupyter installed. You can install it using:
  ```
  pip install jupyter
  ```
  If the issue persists, try restarting your Jupyter server or reinstalling Jupyter.

### Notebook Not Loading
- **Problem**: A notebook fails to load or displays an error.
- **Solution**: Check the console for error messages. Common issues include missing libraries or incorrect paths. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that you are in the correct working directory.

## 3. Code Execution Errors

### Import Errors
- **Problem**: Importing modules fails with an error.
- **Solution**: Verify that the module is installed and correctly spelled. If you are using relative imports, ensure that your working directory is set correctly.

### Runtime Errors
- **Problem**: The code runs but produces unexpected results or crashes.
- **Solution**: Check the input data and parameters. Use print statements or debugging tools to trace the source of the error. Refer to the documentation of the libraries you are using for guidance.

## 4. Application Issues

### Application Crashes
- **Problem**: The application (e.g., FAQ chatbot, summarizer) crashes on execution.
- **Solution**: Check for error messages in the console. Ensure that the input data is in the correct format and that all dependencies are installed.

### Model Performance
- **Problem**: The model does not perform as expected.
- **Solution**: Review the training process and parameters. Ensure that the dataset is appropriate and that the model is fine-tuned correctly. Consider adjusting hyperparameters or using a different model architecture.

## 5. General Tips

- **Documentation**: Always refer to the official documentation of the libraries and tools you are using for the most accurate and detailed information.
- **Community Support**: If you encounter issues that you cannot resolve, consider reaching out to the community forums or discussion groups related to the tools you are using.
- **Backup**: Regularly save your work and create backups of important files to prevent data loss.
