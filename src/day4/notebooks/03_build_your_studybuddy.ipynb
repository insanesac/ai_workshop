    "## 🎯 **What You'll Build:**\n",
    "- 🤖 **Custom AI Agents** - Create your own tutor, session, and goal agents\n",
    "- 💝 **Emotional Intelligence** - Build emotion detection and adaptive responses  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Memory Systems** - Implement conversation tracking and student profiling\n",
    "- 🔧 **Interactive Interface** - Create a working chat system you can actually use\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Coding Challenge Structure:**\n",
    "Each section has **#TODO** tasks for you to complete with detailed hints and guidance. Don't worry - we'll guide you every step of the way!\n",
