    "# Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful technique that combines retrieval and generation to enhance the capabilities of language models. RAG allows models to access external knowledge sources, improving their performance on tasks that require up-to-date or domain-specific information."

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that integrates a retrieval mechanism with a generative model. The key idea is to retrieve relevant documents or information from a knowledge base and use that information to inform the generation process. This approach helps in generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially in scenarios where the model's training data may be outdated or insufficient."

    "## Components of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG system consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant documents or pieces of information from a knowledge base based on the input query.\n",
    "2. **Generator**: This component takes the retrieved information and generates a coherent response or output based on that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between these two components allows the system to leverage external knowledge effectively."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "## How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Query**: The user provides an input query or prompt.\n",
    "2. **Retrieval**: The retriever searches the knowledge base for relevant documents that match the query.\n",
    "3. **Generation**: The generator uses the retrieved documents to produce a response that incorporates the external information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be visualized as follows:\n",

    "## Use Cases for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can be applied in various scenarios, including:\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to user queries by retrieving relevant documents.\n",
    "- **Chatbots**: Enhancing conversational agents with up-to-date information from external sources.\n",
    "- **Content Generation**: Generating articles or summaries based on retrieved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of RAG makes it suitable for a wide range of applications."
