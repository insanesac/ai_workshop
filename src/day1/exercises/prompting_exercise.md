# Prompting Exercise

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to practice prompt engineering techniques using language models. Students will learn how to craft effective prompts to elicit desired responses from models like GPT-2.

## Exercise 1: Basic Prompting
1. **Task**: Write a prompt to generate a short story about a robot learning to dance.
   - **Prompt Example**: "Write a short story about a robot who learns to dance and impresses everyone at a talent show."
   - **Expected Output**: A creative short story that includes elements of humor and surprise.

2. **Reflection**: After generating the story, reflect on the following questions:
   - What aspects of the prompt influenced the output?
   - How could the prompt be modified to change the story's tone or direction?

## Exercise 2: Summarization
1. **Task**: Create a prompt to summarize a given paragraph.
   - **Prompt Example**: "Summarize the following paragraph in two sentences: [Insert paragraph here]."
   - **Expected Output**: A concise summary capturing the main points of the paragraph.

2. **Reflection**: Consider the effectiveness of your prompt:
   - Did the model capture the key points?
   - What changes could improve the summarization?

## Exercise 3: Question Generation
1. **Task**: Develop a prompt to generate questions based on a provided text.
   - **Prompt Example**: "Generate five questions based on the following text: [Insert text here]."
   - **Expected Output**: A list of relevant questions that can be used for discussion or assessment.

2. **Reflection**: Analyze the generated questions:
   - Are they clear and relevant?
   - How could the prompt be adjusted to generate different types of questions?

## Exercise 4: Creative Prompting
1. **Task**: Experiment with creative prompts to generate poetry.
   - **Prompt Example**: "Write a poem about the beauty of nature in spring."
   - **Expected Output**: A poem that captures the essence of spring with vivid imagery.

2. **Reflection**: Evaluate the poem:
   - What emotions does it evoke?
   - How did the prompt shape the style and content of the poem?

## Submission
- Compile your prompts and the corresponding outputs in a document.
- Include your reflections for each exercise.
- Submit your document by the end of Day 1.
