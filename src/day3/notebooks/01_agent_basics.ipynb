    "#### 🛠️ **Built Each Component:**\n",
    "- **👁️ Sensors**: `agent_perceive()` - Analyzes user input for emotions, content type, and context\n",
    "- **🧠 Brain**: `agent_reason()` - Makes decisions about intent and response strategy  \n",
    "- **🤚 Actuators**: `agent_act()` - Takes action and generates appropriate responses\n",
    "- **💾 Memory**: `agent_remember()` & `agent_recall()` - Stores experiences and learns patterns\n",
    "- **🔄 Integration**: `complete_agent_interaction()` - Coordinates all components\n",

    "### 💡 Key Insights Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligence Emerges from Simple Components** - Each part is simple, but together they create intelligent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Loop is Everything** - Perception → Reasoning → Action → Memory creates the intelligence cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Enables Learning** - Without memory, there's no learning or personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modularity Makes Debugging Easy** - Each component can be tested and improved separately\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **This Architecture is Universal** - From simple chatbots to autonomous robots, they all follow this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, you'll learn to:\n",
    "- Add more sophisticated tools and capabilities\n",
    "- Integrate local LLMs for smarter reasoning\n",
    "- Build specialized agents for specific tasks\n",
    "- Coordinate multiple agents working together\n",
